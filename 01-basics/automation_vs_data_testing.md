# Automation Testing vs Data Testing

Automation testing in software and data share **common principles** but have different **subjects under test**.

| Aspect               | Software / UI Automation Testing                | Data Automation Testing                                      |
|----------------------|--------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Subject Under Test** | Applications, APIs, user interfaces             | Databases, data pipelines, data files, data streams           |
| **Main Objective**   | Verify application features and behavior         | Verify correctness, completeness, and reliability of data     |
| **Inputs**           | User actions, API requests                       | Raw data from sources (CSV, DB, APIs, streams)                |
| **Outputs**          | App responses, UI changes                        | Transformed / processed datasets                              |
| **Validation Basis** | Functional requirements, UX flows                | Data quality dimensions, business rules                       |
| **Common Tools**     | Selenium, Playwright, JUnit                       | Great Expectations, Deequ, Soda, dbt tests, Datafold          |

## Key Similarities
- Both use **frameworks** to standardize and automate checks.
- Both integrate with **CI/CD pipelines** for continuous testing.
- Both can adopt **BDD/TDD styles** for test design.

## Key Differences
- In **software testing**, “data” is test input.
- In **data testing**, “data” is the main product being tested.
