# üèó Generic Data Quality (DQ) Framework

A **Data Quality Framework** provides a structured approach to ensure that data is **fit for purpose** and meets business requirements.

This framework is **tool-agnostic** and can be applied regardless of whether you use Great Expectations, Deequ, Soda, dbt tests, or custom scripts.

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Key Phases of a Generic DQ Framework

### 1. Data Ingestion & Source Identification
- Identify **data sources** (databases, APIs, files, streams).
- Capture **metadata** (schemas, formats, update frequency).
- Example activities:
  - Data inventory
  - Source-to-target mapping

---

### 2. Profiling & Baseline Assessment
- Analyze data to understand **current state**.
- Identify typical ranges, patterns, null rates, duplicates.
- Establish **baseline quality metrics**.
- Example activities:
  - Statistical profiling
  - Pattern recognition (e.g., regex checks)

---

### 3. Rule Definition & Configuration
- Define **data quality rules**:
  - **Structural** (schema, types, constraints)
  - **Content** (null checks, domain validation)
  - **Business** (custom logic, joins, relationships)
- Store rules in **config files** or **code modules**.
- Example:
  - ‚ÄúColumn `email` must match regex pattern‚Äù
  - ‚Äú`order_date` cannot be in the future‚Äù

---

### 4. Validation & Execution
- Apply rules against datasets.
- Compare results with baseline thresholds.
- Execute as **batch** or **streaming** validation.
- Example activities:
  - SQL-based checks
  - API-based checks
  - Spark-based checks

---

### 5. Reporting & Alerting
- Summarize results for stakeholders.
- Integrate alerts into **Slack, email, Jira**.
- Provide **pass/fail status** and detailed error samples.
- Example metrics:
  - % of failed rows
  - Number of null violations
  - Outlier detection count

---

### 6. Remediation & Continuous Improvement
- Identify root causes of failures.
- Apply fixes in source or ETL logic.
- Update DQ rules as requirements change.
- Feed learnings into **DataOps / CI/CD pipelines**.

---

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Quality Dimensions Covered
Typical DQ rules check for:
- **Accuracy** ‚Äì Is the data correct?
- **Completeness** ‚Äì Are required fields filled?
- **Consistency** ‚Äì Is data consistent across sources?
- **Timeliness** ‚Äì Is data up-to-date?
- **Uniqueness** ‚Äì Are duplicates avoided?
- **Validity** ‚Äì Does the data conform to rules?

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Why This Matters
- Ensures **trust** in analytics and AI.
- Reduces **operational risks** from bad data.
- Provides a **repeatable process** for scaling data quality efforts.

*This framework can be implemented using any data quality tool ‚Äî open-source or enterprise ‚Äî by mapping each phase to the tool‚Äôs capabilities.*
