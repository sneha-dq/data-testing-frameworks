# 📊 Data Testing Frameworks Knowledge Base

A curated **knowledge repository** on **Data Automation Testing Frameworks** — covering concepts, evolution, mappings, and reusable patterns.

This repo is tool-agnostic and focuses on **framework patterns** first, then shows how they map to data testing tools like Great Expectations, Deequ, Soda, dbt tests, etc.

## 🎯 Goals of This Repository
- Document **different types of automation testing frameworks** and their **data testing equivalents**.
- Explain the **evolution** of data testing approaches.
- Provide **neutral, tool-agnostic mappings** before introducing specific tools.
- Offer **visual diagrams** for presentations and training.

---

## 🛠 How to Use
1. **Browse topics** in the folders above.
2. Use **concept files** for learning/testing interviews.
3. Refer to **diagrams** for training & presentations.
4. **Contribute** by adding examples or updating mappings as tools evolve.

---

## 📌 Roadmap
- [ ] Add detailed Data Quality Dimensions.
- [ ] Create tool-specific mapping guides.
- [ ] Upload diagrams for framework and evolution.
- [ ] Add AI-assisted DQ examples.
