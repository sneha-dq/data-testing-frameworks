Great Expectations (GE) is an open-source Python-based DQ framework focused on **rule-based data validation**.

---

## Phase Coverage

| Generic DQ Phase | Coverage in Great Expectations | Notes |
|------------------|--------------------------------|-------|
| **1. Data Ingestion & Source Identification** | ✅ Connectors for files, databases, cloud storage | Relies on Pandas/Spark/SQLAlchemy backends |
| **2. Profiling & Baseline Assessment** | ✅ Profiling via `expect_*` introspection | Built-in dataset profiler can auto-generate expectations |
| **3. Rule Definition & Configuration** | ✅ YAML or Python-based expectation suites | Large library of built-in expectations; supports custom expectations |
| **4. Validation & Execution** | ✅ Batch processing via Data Context; supports Spark | Can run in pipelines, notebooks, or CI/CD |
| **5. Reporting & Alerting** | ✅ HTML Data Docs; integrations with Slack/Email | Highly visual reports |
| **6. Remediation & Continuous Improvement** | ⚠ Limited automation; requires custom scripting | Can integrate with orchestration tools (Airflow, Prefect) |
