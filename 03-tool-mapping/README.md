# üõ† Tool Mapping for Data Quality Framework

This section maps the **Generic Data Quality Framework** phases to popular **automated data testing tools**.

> üí° The goal is to understand **which tool covers which phase** so you can select or combine tools effectively.

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Phases vs. Capabilities

| Framework Phase                       | Typical Tool Features |
|----------------------------------------|-----------------------|
| **Data Ingestion & Source Identification** | Data connectors, schema inference, metadata capture |
| **Profiling & Baseline Assessment**    | Data profiling, statistics, histograms, null analysis |
| **Rule Definition & Configuration**    | Declarative rule definition (YAML/JSON/SQL), regex checks, custom Python/Scala scripts |
| **Validation & Execution**             | Batch and streaming execution engines, SQL validators, Spark jobs |
| **Reporting & Alerting**               | Dashboards, CLI reports, HTML exports, Slack/Jira/email integration |
| **Remediation & Continuous Improvement** | Auto-ticket creation, integration with ETL pipelines, versioned rules, CI/CD automation |

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Example Tool Mapping (Conceptual)

| Phase | Tool Example 1 | Tool Example 2 | Tool Example 3 |
|-------|---------------|---------------|---------------|
| Data Ingestion | Supports JDBC, S3, GCS connectors | Reads from Kafka | Connects to Snowflake |
| Profiling & Baseline | Profiling APIs | Built-in statistical checks | Schema discovery |
| Rule Definition | YAML config rules | Scala API rules | SQL-based rules |
| Validation | Distributed Spark jobs | Batch SQL execution | Stream processing |
| Reporting | HTML reports | Slack alerts | Grafana dashboards |
| Remediation | API hooks for pipelines | Auto Jira ticket | Version-controlled rules |

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Choosing the Right Tool
When selecting tools for DQ implementation:
- ‚úÖ Check **phase coverage** ‚Äî Some tools specialize in profiling, others in alerting.
- ‚úÖ Ensure **scalability** ‚Äî Large datasets may require distributed execution.
- ‚úÖ Verify **integration** ‚Äî Does it fit with your DataOps / CI/CD pipelines?
- ‚úÖ Look for **extensibility** ‚Äî Can you add custom rules?

---

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Combining Tools
In practice, you may combine tools:
- **Tool A** for profiling & baseline metrics
- **Tool B** for complex validation rules
- **Tool C** for alerting & visualization

This layered approach ensures **comprehensive coverage** without forcing one tool to do everything.
