# 🔍 Data Quality Tool Comparison – Phase Coverage

This table maps the **Generic Data Quality Framework Phases** to capabilities in four popular tools: **Great Expectations, Deequ, Soda, and DQX**.

---

| DQ Framework Phase | Great Expectations | Deequ | Soda | DQX |
|--------------------|--------------------|-------|------|-----|
| **1. Data Ingestion & Source Identification** | ✅ Built-in connectors for DB/files/cloud via Pandas/Spark | ✅ Any Spark-supported source | ✅ Direct DB/cloud warehouse connection | ✅ Connectors for files, APIs, DBs |
| **2. Profiling & Baseline Assessment** | ✅ Dataset profiler auto-generates expectations | ✅ Profiling API + constraint suggestion | ✅ Profiling commands & metric discovery | ✅ Supports custom profiling |
| **3. Rule Definition & Configuration** | ✅ YAML/Python expectation suites | ✅ DSL in Scala/PySpark | ✅ YAML-based checks + SQL | ✅ Config-driven YAML/JSON rules |
| **4. Validation & Execution** | ✅ Batch execution via Data Context; CI/CD friendly | ✅ Distributed Spark execution | ✅ Batch & incremental execution | ✅ Batch & streaming possible |
| **5. Reporting & Alerting** | ✅ HTML Data Docs, Slack, Email | ⚠ JSON output only | ✅ Slack, Teams, Jira, dashboards | ✅ Basic reporting; extendable APIs |
| **6. Remediation & Continuous Improvement** | ⚠ Manual fixes; can integrate with ETL | ⚠ Manual integration; Spark pipelines | ⚠ External remediation systems | ✅ Hooks for auto-remediation scripts |

---

## Legend
- ✅ = Good native support
- ⚠ = Limited; requires custom or external implementation

---

## Observations
- **Great Expectations** → Strong on rule libraries & reports, weaker on remediation.
- **Deequ** → Scales well with Spark; lacks rich reporting.
- **Soda** → Great integration & alerting, but SQL-centric.
- **DQX** → Most flexible/customizable, but depends on user effort.
